I have an existing TryNex Lifestyle e-commerce website that is deployed on Netlify (frontend) and Render (backend). The database is Supabase, and the project is working in real-time.

Now, I want you to enhance, clean up, and finalize the full system by keeping all connections the same, improving the admin panel, and making the full website responsive and ultra-modern.

Here is everything you must follow and implement:

1. ‚úÖ **KEEP EXISTING CONNECTIONS INTACT**
   - Do NOT change the Supabase database URL or API key.
   - Supabase live connection must be maintained as-is.

2. üõ†Ô∏è **BUG FIXES AND FUNCTIONALITY**
   - Fix the issue where **products show in count (52)** in admin panel but do not appear on the Products page or admin panel product list.
   - Fix homepage where **Featured Products** are not displaying properly.
   - Enable filtering and search functionality in the Products page.
   - Ensure real-time sync: Any product changes from the admin panel should instantly reflect on the frontend.

3. üíº **ADMIN PANEL ENHANCEMENTS**
   - Add full control over:
     - Products (add, edit, delete, feature toggle)
     - Promo codes and vouchers (add/edit/delete)
     - Offers / popup banners management
     - Homepage sections (title, hero section, footer content)
     - Order status and real-time updates
   - Allow admin to add **new admin users** and set their credentials.
   - **Trigger access to admin panel** by clicking any footer icon 5 times and entering the password: `Amits@12345`.

4. üí∞ **PRODUCT CATALOG & PRICING (UPDATE & SHOW)**
   Add the following updated product pricing to the database and show on website with high-quality images:

   **T-Shirts:**
   - Basic cotton: 400‡ß≥  
   - Premium cotton: 550‡ß≥  
   - Premium drop-shoulder cotton: 600‡ß≥

   **Mugs:**
   - Regular: 650‡ß≥  
   - 2-piece mugs with free box: 1200‡ß≥  
   - Love shape mug: 680‡ß≥  
   - Magic mug: 750‡ß≥

   **Picture Frames:**
   - Custom design without box: from 1100‡ß≥  
   - With premium box: 1300‡ß≥

   **Water Tumblers (customizable):**
   - 780‡ß≥ each

5. üí≥ **PAYMENT AND ORDER FLOW**
   - Every customer order must require a **100‡ß≥ advance payment** via:
     - bKash / Nagad / Upay: 01747292277
   - Customers should be redirected to WhatsApp for confirmation:
     - WhatsApp number: 01940689487
   - Show order summary and live order tracking status to the customer.
   - Admin must be able to update the status and notes of any order in real-time.

6. üì¶ **FRONTEND IMPROVEMENTS**
   - Add a **"View Details"** modal/page for each product card.
   - Responsive design (perfectly mobile and desktop-friendly).
   - Modern UI with Tailwind CSS (dark/light mode optional).
   - Make sure all components load correctly with fallback handling.

7. üìÅ **FILES & STRUCTURE FORMAT**
   Ensure the project is in this format:
